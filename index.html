                <p class="col-12 text-left">Project Name: Delivery Drone
                    <br> Quality of a software project depends on the project testing strategy. There are multiple testing strategies in the industry to choose from; however some parts of the strategy are kept the same, such as unit testing, Integration
                    testing, validation/regression testing, End to End testing, to name a few. In this project, we are going to evaluate and understand the design of the “Delivery Drone” project and publish the testing strategy plan from the Integration
                    testing (build and procedure) and validation testing stand point.
                    <br><br> To provide some background, let’s understand what we are trying to achieve in this project. In simple words, integration testing covers and tests the scenarios regarding all the integration points of the project such as the
                    API calls to third party services, the interaction with databases etc. Basically, there are two types of integration testing, “Integration testing with Network” and “Integration testing with Functional”. Integration testing with Network
                    focuses on testing all the external calls that your application is making using wiremock etc. On other hand, Integration testing with Functional focus on testing all the business logic of the application with the mock server, test
                    doubles, etc. <br><br> Validation testing is focused on the assertion side of it, whether the application is behaving as expected and as mentioned in the requirements. Many ways and tools are present to perform validation testing such
                    as Selenium, Soap UI etc. <br><br> In this project, we are going to cover three main aspects of the application(mentioned below). Each module or phase will be divided into subsections and will cover system functionality, business functionality
                    and performance functionalities. <br><br> Following system components and their related features are considered to be in scope for testing: <br> 1. Control Module: control module that monitors system parameters and accesses internal
                    memory to obtain instructions. <br> 2. Feedback Module: feedback control systems that control altitude, speed, direction by comparing current information from onboard sensors against the control variable(s) received from the control
                    module. <br> 3. Hardware Module: Contains the objects representing the physical components of the drone that are activated, adjusted, and deactivated by the feedback control systems (Engine, Rotors, Rotational equipment, Package Carrying
                    Component). Also contains additional hardware components like accelerometer, temperature sensors, GPS, internal memory, internal sensors, and the drone battery, etc. <br><br>
